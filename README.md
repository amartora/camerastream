Transmitter and reciever code for an experiment I did where I tried to stream video using UDP packets. The transmitter in this case is a LILYGO TTGO T-Camera which uses an ESP32-WROVER-B and the reciever is the LILYGO TTGO T-Watch 2020. 

Using raw pixel data made the overall outcome to be very slow and choppy video, in the future I would like to try transmitting JPEGs.
